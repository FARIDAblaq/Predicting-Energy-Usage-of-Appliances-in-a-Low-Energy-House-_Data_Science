# Predicting-Energy-Usage-of-Appliances-in-a-Low-Energy-House-_Data_Science
The paper presents the development of data-driven prediction models for the energy use of appliances in a low-energy house, based on a dataset collected in a real-life scenario that has weather and appliance data.
The gathered data comprises data on user behavior, environmental factors, and appliance energy consumption and a number of machine learning-based prediction models, such as Multivariate Linear Regression were created. In order to boost the accuracy of the models created, a feature selection and dimensionality reduction of the dataset was made to increase accuracy and performance. However, little or no improvement was achieved based on the mean squared error as a measure of accuracy with the best model being those of Linear regression with all of the variables and another linear regression model built after a dimensionality reduction using PCA with a mean squared error of 8678.53. Mean squared error, root mean squared error and coefficient of determination are the measurement of performance and accuracy used for all the models built.
